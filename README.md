# Garbage Monitoring System using NodeMCU

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Garbage Monitoring System using NodeMCU ESP8266, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, Arduino IDE, and Blynk IoT mobile app. The system uses the ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to the garbage level in a bin and sends the data to the Blynk app, allowing for remote monitoring and alerts when the bin needs to be emptied.

### Hardware Components

- NodeMCU ESP8266
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires

### Software Components

- Arduino IDE
- Blynk IoT mobile app

### Features

- Real-time distance measurement using ultrasonic sensor
- Data sent to Blynk app for remote monitoring
- Alerts and notifications when bin needs to be emptied
- Customizable threshold values for alerts

## Getting Started

1. Install the necessary libraries and software
2. Connect the hardware components
3. Upload the code to the NodeMCU ESP8266
4. Configure the Blynk app

## Code Structure
